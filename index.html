                <h2>Fronted Developer</h2>
                <p>
My name is Nagham, and I am a Computer Systems Engineering student with a strong passion for front-end development. Over the past year, I have been actively learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I earned a Responsive Web Design certificate from freeCodeCamp as part of my self-learning journey.

I am very eager to join this course because I see it as an important step in deepening my understanding of modern front-end technologies, especially React, which I am highly motivated to master. I believe this program will provide me with practical experience, professional guidance, and the opportunity to work on real-world projects that will help me grow both technically and personally.

I am dedicated to learning and committed to becoming a skilled front-end developer. Being part of this course would be a valuable opportunity that brings me closer to my career goals.
